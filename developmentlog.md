**April 9 (W1)**: Created and committed the project proposal and team contract. Wrote and included my name in the document. Decided to use the OpenFlights database and planned to use algorithms to determine the shortest path between two airports. Also, outlined the project timeline and solutions to potential disagreements on the project framework.

**April 16 (W2)**: Wrote and committed the makefile, referencing other assignments in the class. The makefile specifies which parts of the project to execute, including the test files and main files (objects) to run.

**April 23 (W3)**: Committed changes to the makefile by removing extraneous data and adding new objects that might be useful for the project.

**April 30 (W4)**: Committed most of the Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra algorithm, and data parsing. Encountered a roadblock with data parsing and figured out how to take in each line and put it into containers for use by other objects. Created individual classes for Breadth-First Search and Dijkstra's Algorithm.

**May 7 (W5)**: Worked on the Breadth-First Search constructor, Breadth-First Search `shortestPath()` function, data parsing, writing test cases, and completing the data parsing. Fully implemented data parsing for use by other objects and wrote documentation for the project.

**May 9 (W6)**: Implemented the full BFS traversal and completed Dijkstra's Path Finding algorithm. Created pre-emptive plans for test cases for both algorithms.

**May 11 (W6)**: Fully implemented the A* Path Finding algorithm and implemented most of the test cases for the classes.

**May 12 (DEADLINE)**: Wrote additional test cases and finished the presentation, development log, and a 2-page .md file describing the entirety of the project.
